My idea is to integrate Dialogflow CX into Telephony platform. 
Here in my idea i am using Twilio as Telephony platform, where i receive a call and use Google dialogflow cx as ASR component. 
The idea here is to get all the intent a user says in IVR application. 
My idea is to help Indian community supporting age group of 55+ who has difficulty in using Web, or Mobile application. 
IVR is good for senior citizen, thanks to my parents, this idea is generated seeing my parents who had this difficulty using Web or Mobile application.
